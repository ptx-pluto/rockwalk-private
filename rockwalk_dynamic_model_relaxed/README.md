## Dynamic model for a falling rolling disk subject to both holonomic and nonholonomic constraints

## Execution
* First run the script `rolling_disk_eom.m` to generate Euler-Lagrange equations of a rolling disk. Lagrange-D'Alembert equations can be obtained by running the script `rolling_disk_LdA_eom.m`.
* Then, run the script `fixed_apex_dynamics.m` to generate acceleration vectors and Lagrange multipliers for a cone that rolls with its apex fixed
* Finally, run the script `solve_fixed_apex_dynamics.m` to solve for fixed apex case. 

* TODO: To visualize fixed-apex dynamics, add the ros package.
